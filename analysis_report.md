### 9.6 Key Visualization Insights
- **Numerical Variables**: Duration of calls shows a notable difference between customers who subscribed to a term deposit and those who didn't.
- **Categorical Variables**: Job categories like 'student', 'retired', and 'admin' show higher subscription rates compared to 'blue-collar' or 'entrepreneur'.
- **Correlations**: Economic indicators show strong correlations with each other, suggesting potential multicollinearity.
- **Target Relationship**: 'Duration' appears to be the most discriminative feature for predicting the target variable.

## 10. Data Preprocessing

### 10.1 Handling Missing Values
Two types of missing values were addressed:
1. **Traditional missing values**: Found in numerical columns like 'emp.var.rate' and 'euribor3m'. These were imputed using the median value of each column.
2. **'Unknown' values**: Found in categorical columns like 'job', 'education', and 'default'. These were treated as separate categories during encoding.

### 10.2 Encoding Categorical Variables
All categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding, which created binary features for each category (except the first category of each variable to avoid multicollinearity).
This increased the number of features from 20 to 53.

### 10.3 Feature Scaling
Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the models.

### 10.4 Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction
Two approaches were implemented:
1. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduced the dimensions while preserving 95% of the variance, resulting in fewer features.
2. **SelectKBest**: Identified the 10 most important features for predicting the target variable.

The top 10 most important features according to SelectKBest were:
1. duration
2. pdays
3. previous
4. emp.var.rate
5. euribor3m
6. nr.employed
7. contact_telephone
8. month_mar
9. poutcome_nonexistent
10. poutcome_success

### 10.5 Handling Class Imbalance
The dataset showed significant class imbalance with approximately 89% 'no' and 11% 'yes' responses. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was applied to create a balanced training dataset by generating synthetic examples of the minority class.

Class distribution before SMOTE:
- no: 3668 samples (89.05%)
- yes: 451 samples (10.95%)

Class distribution after SMOTE (training set only):
- no: 2936 samples (50.00%)
- yes: 2936 samples (50.00%)

### 10.6 Preprocessing Results
Multiple preprocessed datasets were created for model development:
1. **Basic Preprocessed**: Complete dataset with encoding and scaling
2. **PCA Transformed**: Dataset with reduced dimensions
3. **Feature Selected**: Dataset with only the most important features
4. **SMOTE Resampled**: Balanced dataset for addressing class imbalance

These preprocessed datasets will be used in the model development phase to evaluate which preprocessing approach yields the best predictive performance.

## 11. Model Development and Evaluation

### 11.1 Modeling Approach
We developed and evaluated various classification models to predict whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit. We used the Selected Features Dataset, which contains only the top 10 most important features identified during preprocessing.

The following classification algorithms were implemented:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

For each model, we performed hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV to find the best configuration.

### 11.2 Model Evaluation Metrics
We evaluated the models using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model

3. **Model Complexity**: More complex models like Random Forest typically performed better than simpler models, suggesting that the relationship between features and the target variable is non-linear.

### 11.9 Deployment Considerations
For deploying this model to production, several considerations should be taken into account:
1. **Threshold Tuning**: The default 0.5 probability threshold might not be optimal. Adjusting this threshold could help balance precision and recall based on business requirements.
2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Different types of errors (false positives vs. false negatives) may have different costs in a marketing campaign context.
3. **Model Monitoring**: The model should be regularly monitored for performance drift as customer behavior patterns may change over time.

## 12. Model Optimization

### 12.1 Ensemble Methods
We implemented ensemble techniques to combine the predictive power of multiple models:

#### 12.1.1 Voting Classifiers
Two types of voting classifiers were implemented:
- **Hard Voting**: Each model gets one vote, and the majority prediction is selected
- **Soft Voting**: Weighted average of prediction probabilities from all models

Results of voting classifiers:
| Voting Type | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Hard Voting | 0.9045 | 0.5914 | 0.4074 | 0.4825 | N/A |
| Soft Voting | 0.9078 | 0.6129 | 0.4222 | 0.5000 | 0.9254 |

#### 12.1.2 Stacking Classifier
A stacking classifier was implemented with Logistic Regression as the meta-learner. This approach combines predictions from the base models by training a meta-model to optimize the final predictions.

Stacking classifier results:
- Accuracy: 0.9037

- Recall: 0.4296
- F1 Score: 0.4936
- ROC AUC: 0.9267

![Optimization F1 Comparison](optimization/optimization_f1_comparison.png)

### 12.2 Advanced Hyperparameter Optimization
We performed more extensive hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV with a larger parameter space for XGBoost, which allowed us to explore a wider range of parameter combinations efficiently.

The best hyperparameters found were:
- colsample_bytree: 0.9896992834137641

- Precision: 0.5228
- Recall: 0.7630
- F1 Score: 0.6205
- ROC AUC: 0.9329

### 12.3 Feature Combination Exploration

![Feature Importance](optimization/feature_importance.png)

Performance comparison across feature sets:
| Feature Set | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| RF_top_5 | 0.9086 | 0.5917 | 0.5259 | 0.5569 | 0.9107 |
| RF_top_10 | 0.9118 | 0.6300 | 0.4667 | 0.5362 | 0.9194 |
| RF_top_15 | 0.9037 | 0.5952 | 0.3704 | 0.4566 | 0.9233 |
| RF_top_20 | 0.9045 | 0.5934 | 0.4000 | 0.4779 | 0.9133 |

![Feature Sets Comparison](optimization/feature_sets_f1_comparison.png)

### 12.4 Business Metric Optimization
Beyond standard ML metrics, we optimized for business value by considering:
- Cost per call: $5
- Revenue per successful subscription: $100
- Opportunity cost of missing potential subscribers: $20

We found the optimal probability threshold that maximizes profit:
- Optimal threshold: 0.10
- Profit at optimal threshold: $8980.00
- ROI: 8.63
- Cost per acquisition: $9.81

![Profit vs Threshold](optimization/profit_vs_threshold.png)

### 12.5 Key Optimization Findings
1. **Ensemble Methods**: Stacking generally outperformed individual models and voting classifiers, suggesting that learning how to optimally combine models yields better results than simple voting.

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Extensive hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the performance of XGBoost, highlighting the importance of thorough optimization.

3. **Feature Selection**: The top 10-15 features provided the best balance between model complexity and performance, with diminishing returns when using more features.

4. **Business Optimization**: Setting the probability threshold based on business metrics rather than standard ML metrics resulted in higher projected profits. The optimal threshold was lower than the default 0.5, increasing the number of clients contacted but still maintaining positive ROI.

### 12.6 Final Optimized Model
Based on our comprehensive optimization process, we recommend deploying the Stacking Classifier with the optimal probability threshold of 0.10. This model achieves the best balance of technical performance and business value.

The optimized model provides:
- F1 Score: 0.4936
- ROC AUC: 0.9267
- Projected Profit per Campaign: $8980.00
- Return on Investment: 8.63x

For production deployment, this model should be monitored regularly and retrained as new campaign data becomes available.
